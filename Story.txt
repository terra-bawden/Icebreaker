There once was a Hund from Deutschland.
He went to the biergarten in Rammstein.
The special of the day was a house-made apfelkuchen. Delicious.
He had never tasted a more scrumptious Gebaeck!
He asked the barman of the biergarten from where the delicious gebaeck had come, and the barman told him it was from the baeckerei at Schloss Eltz, so he set out at once to visit the baeckerei in person.
But first the hund had to get a small brot for his jurney.
After the hund procured the brot it was heading to the Flughafen.
On his drive there in his BMW, a Porsche became wettbewerbsfaehig.
They zoomed down Hauptstrasse, at each others necks the whole way.
Altough it was close, the brot gave the hund super powers and the hund got to the flughafen first.
Or so he thought, as his head collided with the Mehlhase's. No one beats a rabbit.
She sprinted to the schloss that was in Raesfeld.
Along the way the hund stopped at a popular Ratskeller known for it Doener.
"Hmph," said the hund, "I should have ordered the bratwurst."
Unsatisfied, the hund went to a Baeckerei he saw and got a Gebaeck.
As the Hund enjoyed his gebaeck, he spotted a local wearing a dirndl and lederhose, who invited him to join a friendly competition at the schloss in Raesfeld.
